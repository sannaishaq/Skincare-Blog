     <h1> Sak's Skincare Picks:  </h1> 
      <p className='intro'>
        Hey there, welcome to my page! My name is Sakinah Ishaq and I am a skincare enthusiest from Leesburg Virginia! 
        I believe that skincare is a way of bringing people together from all over the world. Well...because
        everyone has skin! I love learning about different skincare routines as well as the various compounds that go into a product.
        With a background in Public Health, I've learned a lot about how different chemical compounds affect our biology. 
        With all that being said, I've decided to create this blog to highlight my top skincare picks. Instead of a normal blog,
        I decided to create a "shopping" experience for my lovely guests. Feel free to add as many items you like to your 
        cart to keep track of your picks! Each item includes a description as well as some reviews for you to check out, just 
        click on the picture of the item to change your view between review or description. I've also included a 'skin-type' 
        section for each item so you can peruse them using the search bar based on your own skin type! I've also added links for where you can find 
        each of the items. I'd love to get some feedback from you so feel free to leave your own reviews/experiences with the items, 
        as well as your own personal skincare picks!
